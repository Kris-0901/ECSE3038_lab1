"""
1. Write a function, `parallel()`, that, when called, prints the effective resistance of a network of resistors 
connected in parallel. The function should be able to accept a single **list** as argument.
    
    Use the example provided below to test the functionality of your function. ie, 
    copy the line below into your python script to call the function you wrote. 
    
    ```python
    parallel([330, 1000, 2200])
    ```
    
    Your script should print the following:
    
    ```python
    "222.973 ohms"
    ```

3. Write a function, temperature_check(), that accepts a single number, a patient's body 
temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function should output whether 
the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function. 
The second value passed as argument should tell the function whether the 
condition should calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit.
An appropriate message should be written to the screen with the result. 
Youâ€™re free to use what ever reasonable temperature limits you feel will adequately act as boundaries for these conditions.
eg. 
> temperature_check(14, "C")
> "the patient is hypothermic"

> temperature_check(37, "C")
